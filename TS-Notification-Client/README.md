# Notification Client âœ¨

Client to test the API server. 

Please don't judge me on the style! This is something I quickly put together just to test.

## Requirements

Simply open the file index.html with a web browser.

The file `script.ts` is already compiled into `script.js`.

## Compiling

To compile `script.ts`, you'll need to use the following command:

```bash
tsc script.ts --lib "es2015, dom"
```

This is to avoid "async function or method in ES5/ES3 requires the 'Promise' constructor".
