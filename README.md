# Notification System :sparkles:
A complete notification system with its API server and a sample client, entirely implemented in TypeScript without using any framework or extra library. The API can send a new notification, list all unread notifications, and mark a notification as read. Data are retrieved and stored using a JSON file.

This is the very first work I've ever done in TypeScript, and it has been quite a project for me to start learning this language with! Not using any frameworks or libraries to create an API server has been a challenge I really enjoyed! Please feel free to dive deep into the code and see how it works.
